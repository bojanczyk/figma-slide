This is a program for making zooming slides in figma.
It consists of (a) a figma plugin; (b) a viewer page in html; (c) a server program that mediates between the first two.

Instructions.

1. Install the plugin in figma. The steps for this:
- to "Manage Plugins" from the "Plugins" menu
- select "Create Plugin" from the "In Development Column"
- select "Click to choose a manifest.json file"
- select the manifest.json file from the slajdomat directory
So far, I have only tested the osx non-web client
(There is another plugin, very raw, called "matematyk", which does some latex support.)

2. Run the server. 
- run "node node-server.js" in the viewer directory
You will need the following software: node.js and ffmpeg.
Also, you will probably need to install some modules in node.js
I will try to create a distribution bundle which means that you will not need to install all of this software.

3. Start using the plugin, when you are ready click the "play" button, which will send the data to the server. As a result, several svg files will appear in the viewer directory.

4. To view the slides, open the following page in your browser: http://localhost:8080/viewer.html
