1. Install the plugin in figma. The steps for this:
- to "Manage Plugins" from the "Plugins" menu
- select "Create Plugin" from the "In Development Column"
- select "Click to choose a manifest.json file"
- select the manifest.json file from the plugin directory
So far, I have only tested the osx non-web client

2. Run the server. 
- run "node node-server.js" in the viewer directory
You should install ffmpeg if you want the sounds to work properly

3. Start using the plugin, when you are ready click the "play" button, which will send the data to the server. As a result, several svg files will appear in the viewer directory.

4. To view the slides, open the following page in your browser: http://localhost:8080/viewer.html
